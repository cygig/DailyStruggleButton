# DailyStruggleButton
DailyStruggleButton is yet another Arduino library to debounce button (push tactile switch) and manage its events. Events supported include pressing, releasing, holding down, long pressing (hold button for x time) and multi-hitting (hit button x times in y  time). For simplicity, there is only one callback function for all events, that passes an identifier as a parameter to indicate the event that just happened.

# Button events

For every instance of Dailybutton, there is only one callback function. A callback function is a user defined function that DailyStruggleButton will call when a button event occurs. This callback function takes a parameter _buttonEvent_ of _byte_ datatype.  It is essentially positive whole numbers from 0 to 255.

_buttonEvent_ is updated before the function is being called back. Thus, you can use `switch` /`case` or `if`/`else` to dictate what to do in each situation.

Numerical Equivalent | Definition | Explanation
:--------------------|:-----------|:-----------
0 | `neverPressed`|The button is never pressed. This is used internally only.
1 | `onPress` | The button is pushed.
2 | `onRelease` | The button is let go.
3 | `onHold` | The button is held down. Be careful as this will keep calling back multiple times until the button is let go.
4 | `onLongPress` | The button was held down for a `longPressTime` length of time.
5 | `onMultiHit` | The button was pushed and let go for `onMultiHitTarget` number of times within `onMultiHit` milliseconds.

Here is an example:
```
#include <DailyStruggleButton>

DailyStruggleButton myButton;

void setup(){
	myButton.set(0, myCallback);
}
void loop(){
	myButton.poll();
}
void myCallback(byte buttonEvent){
	switch (buttonEvent){
		case onPress:
			// Do something...
			break;
		case onRelease:
			// Do something...
			break;
	}
}
```


# Setting up for the example code

To set up the example code, you need a Arduino (we tested it on Pro Micro but it should work on most common ones too) and a push tactile button.

One end of the button is connected to Pin 4, while the other is connected to ground. 

The internal pull-up resistor will ensure Pin 4 does not float (change between `HIGH` and `LOW` sporadically}, rather stay on `HIGH` (hence pull-**up**) unless it is deliberately connected to ground. When it is connected to ground, it becomes `LOW`, thus the logic is inverted, where `LOW` is pressed and `HIGH` is released. You need not be bothered with the inverted logic as DailyStruggleButton will take care of it, as long as you set the pull-up/down right in `set()`, which defaults to internal pulled up if not specified.

# Public Functions
## DailyStruggleButton()

Constructor, not used. 



##  _void_ set( _byte_ myPin, _void_ (*myCallback)(_byte_ buttonEvent) )

Initialises the button. _myPin_ sets the digital pin the button is connected to. _myCallback_ is a callback function that the instance will call when an event occur. This event will be pass as _buttonEvent_. 
```
...
void setup(){
	myButton.set(0, callback);
}
...
callback(byte myEvent){
...
} 
```



##  _void_ set( _byte_ myPin, _void_ (*myCallback)(_byte_ buttonEvent), _byte_ myPull )

This is similar to the other _set()_ function, but allows for a third parameter to set the pull-up/down of the button. You can use one of the following:

`INT_PULL_UP`
Uses the internal pull-up resistor, most common use case, selected by default is this parameter is not entered.    

`EXT_PULL_UP`
You are to use your own external pull-up resistor, internal one will not be used.

`EXT_PULL_DOWN`
You are to use your own external pull-down resistor, internal one will not be used.

Internal pull-down is not supported. It is important to select the right pull-up/down as the library will decided if the logic should be inverted. 



## _bool_ poll()

Leave this function inside _loop()_ so it checks on the button constantly. 
Returns 1 if polled successfully. Returns 0 if button debounce failed.
```
void loop(){
	myButton.poll();
	...
}
```


## _void_ setDebounceTime(_unsigned int_ myTime)

To debounce a button in software is to read the state of the button, wait for a while and make sure the button state remains during this time. This is to filter out mechanical bouncing in push tactile switches. 

_myTime_ sets the waiting time in milliseconds. By default 20ms is used and usually there is no need to call this function. 



## _void_ enableLongPress(_unsigned int_ myTime)
Turn on long press detection. You need to hold the button down for _myTime_ in milliseconds for the event to register.



## _void_ disableLongPress()
Turn off long press detection.



## _void_ enableMultiHit(_unsigned int_ myTime, _byte_ myTarget)
Turn on multi-hit detection. You need to press the button_myTarget_ number of times within _myTime_ in milliseconds for the event to register.



## _void_ disableMultiHit()
Turn off multi-hit detection.
